# Moodify-Learning
Assignments made while learning and implementing python and ML during the project

**Week 1 and Assignment 1** 


In this week , I brushed up my python skills by reviewing the wncc course for python . I also went through some of the documentation of important libraries like numpy , pandas and matplotlib. 
The assignmentfor this week was basically to test our understanding of python. It is a simple virus simulation task with the usage of numpy and matplotlib libraries.

**Week 2 and Assignment 2**

I started off with the introduction to Machine Learning Course , wherein I learnt about linear regression and classification through various hands-on code.
(Yet to upload Assignment 2)

**Week 3**


This week , I completed the Machine Learing crash course by Google upto L1 regularization and made a report on it.

# Integrated Image and Musc Classification model for Moodify

In order to test the program run classify.py. It has the function recommend which takes link to the image and music source as an input and returns a list of songs 
for that mood. In order to run these you will need to have MTCNN, numpy **1.19**, scikit learn **0.23.2**, tensorflow, keras.
